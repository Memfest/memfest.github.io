        <h1>Celebrating the Life of Memorie King</h1>

    <p>I met Memorie about ten years ago when we were both working at the French Broad Food Coop in Asheville. My first encounter with her demonstrated her kind and generous character. I was taking a large soup tureen into the walk in cooler and was holding it in one hand while trying to open the  cooler door with the other.  Almost predictably, I spilled a large puddle of soup.  As I was cursing under my breath, Memorie said in a cheerful voice, "Here, let me clean that up for you." I had never laid eyes on her prior to that moment, but I took an instant liking to her.  She had such a cheerful, kind, and calm demeanor that anyone who was around her for any length of time, felt calm and was put in a better mood. The more I got to know her the more I liked her.  I recall asking how old she was. At that time she was 50 or 51 and when she told me her age, I was almost in a state of shock as she looked easily 10 years younger. She was so blessed to be an Old Soul amongst us and have such a forever young look and attitude. My biggest regret was not getting in my car and driving to her and Loch's farm to visit. We should all be thankful for the time we had with Memorie.</p>

    <p>Memorie King was not a celebrity but she was the rare person who lived the changes she wanted to see. She gave up working for Glaxo Pharmaceuticals because of concerns about animal cruelty and despite graduating from NC State with honors became a massage therapist because she wanted to help people. When that became too difficult physically she moved to Asheville and studied herbal healing and devoted the last years of her life to growing plants and educating people about natural healing, good nutrition and the dangers of chemical pesticides. In addition she operated a Community Supported Agriculture organization which furnished healthy chemical free food. She was also a rare person because she had no enemies. Everybody liked her and if they got to know her well enough they loved her. So Memfest is not a celebration of her fame or wealth but of a life well lived.</p>
    <p>On September 27, the night that the moon is closest to earth, which is highly relevant to Memorie's spiritual beliefs, her friends are coming together at Beans 'n Berries farm where she lived the last years of her life to celebrate the person she was and all the good effects she had on everyone she touched. Her friends Molly, Eleanor and Salley of Underhill Rose; Utah (Kerry) Green and the Wright Family Band are giving a free concert at her farm in South Bottleneck NC equidistant between Asheville and Charlotte. The concert is free but not a benefit or a charity. The musicians are being paid from her estate. She would have wanted it that way because she believed people  should be paid and paid well for the good things they do. The music will begin about five and continue under the full moon as long as people want to play. Red wine and barbecue will be laid on because she loved those but since there are no tickets it might be wise to bring something of your own. Details and photos can be found on her <a href="">website</a>.<p>
    <p>Though Mem always tried to do the right thing and her greatest pleasure was making others happy she suffered terribly at the end of her life. As all too often happens she received inadequate medical attention and was in fact denied service by Dr. Jason Zuck of Western Carolina Orthopedics. He made it quite clear that he believed her to be a fake and a drug hound when in fact she was suffering from an exploded t-8 vertebra. This negligence which borders on the criminal resulted in a month of unnecessary suffering and six trips to the emergency room before a proper diagnosis was made almost by accident. Ironically, or perhaps presciently, the multiple myeloma that took her life on January 8, 2014 was almost certainly caused by exposure to Sevin (carbyl)  a pesticide manufactured by Union Carbide Corp. In 1977-78 when she worked for the NC State Vet school her supervisors believed Union Carbide's claims of  "perfect safety"  and failed to provide the appropriate gloves and masks. Memorie, like many really good people trusted others sometimes too much and she paid with her life.</p>
    <p>Rather than the suffering mostly we want to remember the great person she was rather than the terrible things that happened to her. So this festival will be a musical celebration of her life and works and I hope will honor and promulgate her memory as she wished.  If everyone lived as she did this would be a better world; no, not just better but close to perfect. So please help me keep her memory alive not for my sake, or even for hers, but most of all for all for the people she touched.</p>
